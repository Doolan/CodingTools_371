Why CodeCombat?
If you want to learn to program, you don't need lessons. You need to write a lot of code and have a great time doing it.

That's what programming is about. It's gotta be fun. Not fun like yay a badge but fun like NO MOM I HAVE TO FINISH THE LEVEL! That's why CodeCombat is a multiplayer game, not a gamified lesson course. We won't stop until you can't stop--but this time, that's a good thing.

If you're going to get addicted to some game, get addicted to this one and become one of the wizards of the tech age.
